						"One day I'm gonna sing for that band", was Douglas Robinson's prophetic
						reaction the first time he saw his future bandmates play. A chance
						invitation to catch a new act had found Douglas riding unfamiliar trains
						on the other side of the country from his New York home. World weary and
						on the west coast in search of a break from music, Douglas nearly skipped
						the occasion all together. Curiosity and the urge to support fellow
						musicians got the best of him and, nearly serendipitously, the fates
						aligned. He was headed to the city of Fullerton to catch an instrumental
						three piece he had never heard of before. The music he heard that night
						cut him to the core with inspiration.

						Nick DePirro (guitar), Reilly Herrera (bass), and Aric Improta
						(drums/samples) had been playing in bands around Orange County for years.
						As line ups came and went the core three maintained a strict practice
						schedule and composed at a prolific rate. Frustration after numerous
						failed singer auditions eventually led them to book and play shows as a
						trio. Socializing before a gig they were surprised to meet a vocalist
						whose work with The Sleeping they had respected for years. Fortunately,
						after their set, the admiration was mutual. The friendship and
						collaboration that would become Night Verses began that night.

						Night Verses enjoyed a break-out first year in 2012,  including the
						release of their Kris Crummett produced Out of the Sky EP, the premiere of
						the Dannel Escallon directed video for "Be Happy With Yourself, I'm
						Staying Here In Hell", frenetic introductory shows in Los Angeles &amp; New
						York, and a tour across the U.K.  Early 2013 found the band teaming up
						again with producer Kris Crummett to record their first debut full length
						album.  Lift Your Existence was released to critical acclaim in June of
						2013.  Extensive touring across 17 countries, 6 territories, and 32 states
						with acts such as letlive., Protest The Hero, and Norma Jean have kept
						Night Verses' fan base expanding and their profile rising.  The video for
						"Celestial Fires" was premiered by Kerrang! in July of 2014.  They
						recently supported the reunited The Fall Of Troy at Webster Hall, NY and
						brought in 2015 by playing their first headlining dates in Anchorage,
						Alaska.  The band is currently writing their second full length album, to
						be release by Graphic Nature Records, and will be heading into the studio
						with multi-platinum record producer Ross Robinson in the Fall of 2015.
